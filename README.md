# Web-Scraping-Test
This program gathers the information of doctors from the Arkansas State Medical Board from a given search query and outputs all the results as a CSV file. The results file that I produced is included as results.csv

This was run in Eclipse 4.5.2 on Windows 10 with the following .jar files added to the libraries of the project:

[jaunt1.1.8.jar](http://jaunt-api.com/download.htm)

[commons-csv-1.4.jar](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-csv/download_csv.cgi)

[HtmlUnit Library - 2.22](https://sourceforge.net/projects/htmlunit/files/htmlunit/)

The 'lib' folder in the HtmlUnit download was added as a custom library while Jaunt and the Apache Commons CSV .jars were added as extrenal .jars.
